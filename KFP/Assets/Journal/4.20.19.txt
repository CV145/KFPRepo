Goal: Clicking anywhere on screen spawns a raycast which can be used to hurt an enemy

--- The Plan ---
Invisible game object (an arrow to represent for debugging) used as "fire point". This is where the ray cast starts. It rotates to look at mouse position.
Assets to get: 
- Arrow

Script: FirePointerRotation
Game object: Firepoint
- Works to rotate the fire point to look at where the mouse is in the world. Mouse position converted from screen space to in-game world space

Script: PlayerShoot
GameObject: Player
Works with and requires: ShootRaycastDetector
- Creates a raycast when mouse is clicked/screen touched from the fire point and towards its forward vector direction (which should be where the mouse/finger is) for a fixed, variable length from inspector. If the raycast hits something it returns a RaycastHit, which is then passed to ShootRaycastDetector. A line is also drawn and created to represent the raycast in-game


Script: ShootRaycastDetector
GameObject: Player
- Has methods that take in a RaycastHit and can be called to trigger events on objects that were hit, for example reducing hits on an object or triggering a switch


Script: DestructibleObject
GameObject: Any object that can be destroyed by player bullets
- Stores a hits variable and has a TakeDamage method that, when called, reduces hits by 1. Once those hits reach 0 an event can be raised, such as spawning an explosion or playing an animation, apart from destroying the object.
