Goal: Clicking anywhere on screen spawns a raycast which can be used to hurt an enemy

--- The Plan ---
Invisible game object (an arrow to represent for debugging) used as "fire point". This is where the ray cast starts. It rotates to look at mouse position.
Assets to get: 
- Arrow

Script: FirePointerRotation
Game object: Firepoint
- Works to rotate the fire point to look at where the mouse is in the world. Mouse position converted from screen space to in-game world space

Script: PlayerShoot
GameObject: KFP
- Creates a raycast from the fire point and towards its forward vector direction (which should be where the mouse/finger is) for a fixed, variable length from inspector

Script: ShootRaycastDetector
GameObject: Any object interacting with a player bullet raycast
- Used to signify that the game object has been hit by a raycast
